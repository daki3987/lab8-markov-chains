## Overview
This repository contains my written answers for **Lab 8: Markov Chains**.
The lab focuses on understanding matrix multiplication, graph walks, and Markov chains, as well as how these ideas can be applied to predictive paging.

## Contents
- `Lab8_Markov_Chains_Answers.md` — answers to all lab questions.



## Key Takeaways
- Matrix multiplication can be parallelized by distributing rows or blocks among threads.
- Powers of an adjacency matrix count walks of corresponding lengths.
- A Markov chain’s powers show multi-step transition probabilities.
- In paging systems, Markov models can guide both prefetching** and eviction policies.
